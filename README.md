# webParsing_stockSelector

I am passionate about finance. I have a personal stock portfolio and I invest regularly in value compagnies undervaluated by the market. I have my own method for stock picking but with more than 1700 listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) I miss sometime good opportunities with hidden gems.

So I thought about teach my method to Python, then I could do what I do to study companies account (half an hour each) in few minutes for all companies listed on the Stock exchange.

All I needed was some key data for the companies, like Gearing, current Price and Asset value per share.

I used Beautiful Soup to parse the LSE website to collect data, and then apply my stock picking method on the data to get a list of companies underevaluated.
